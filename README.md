# Curry Lang - A matter of taste

Curry is a conceptual programming language made as a educational project.
It's based on the whim that it would be nice to try to implement an own programming language.
It's intended to test wild ideas and to grapple with compiler construction.

## Philosophy
Curry intends to be a multiparadigm programming language
that embraces concepts of functional, object oriented and procedural programming language.
Curry is a static typed language.

As the author, I'm heavily influenced by Java, Typescript, JavaScript and PHP.
 Although or because a lot of my work experience stems from dynamic programming languages, I highly prefer
 static type checking.
 
 A short list of thoughts:
 - Dear Java: null was never a million dollar mistake. The mistake was to not embrace it in the type system.
 - I like babel and the idea to extend the language itself. LaTeX is similar in that regard. Would be nice to embrace it
 in a programming language. Support requests might be trouble some though.
 - A programming language thrives from the package & project management toolchain and how easy it is to reuse and extend.
 Not a problem for theoretical languages though. L0L
 - I like curly braces tbh.
 - You should be able to understand things, but you don't have to. Embrace the consistent voodoo.
 - Embrace the IDE. The language doesn't need to shine most on paper. Makes a theoretical language probably ugly though. :D
 
 
## Development state
The project originated from the whim to look into compiler contruction.
At the time of start, I wanted to look into GraalVM and its language framework Truffle.
The simplelanguage thats currently part of the project is the example of truffle framework and in here for reference.

Currently, the language development itself is on hold and specification work is in progress.
There fore, curry can be considered a theoretical programming language only, currently.

### Roadmap
I'll document concepts of Curry with some kind of test as description.
We'll see once I'll implement language features again. Maybe the language framework will change as well.
